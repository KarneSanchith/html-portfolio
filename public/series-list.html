<h1>The best series according to sanchith</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Mentalist</h3>
<p>The best thing i liked in this series of "The Mentalist" is that how the starrer reads the minds and body language of the people or the corpse just by looking at them.<br>
    And the starrer always plays out of the book in figuring out the murderer.  
</p>
<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>in these series the best part i liked is the never ending friendship between the friends.</p>
<h3>Squid Game</h3>
<p>In these series I learnt that people risk their lives and also sabotage their team members in the brink of poverty, And also how money is a major aspect in one's life.
